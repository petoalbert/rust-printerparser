## TODO
- [ ] streaming parsing / printing
- [ ] combinator that fails of the rest of the input is not empty (`complete` in nom?)
- [ ] create lib.rs for the parser/printer stuff, and move json to an examples file

## "Research" ideas
- [ ] a printer that consumes the input (would this require code duplication? how much?)
- [ ] continuation passing style?
